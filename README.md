## What is Sucklessthing?

BanditHijo's Suckless script for manage & maintain the suckless app.

## Installation

Just run,

```shell
$ ./install.rb
```

This `install.rb` will automatically copy all suckscript to **~/.local/bin/**.

If you doesn't have local path bin, it will create for you.

If you does have, don't worry, it **will not** replace all your files inside local path.

Just run it, you'll be safe.
