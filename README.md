## What is Sucklessthing?

BanditHijo's Suckless script for manage & maintain the suckless app.

## Info!

I've renamed `suckmerge2` to `suckmerge`.

## Installation

Just run,

```shell
$ ./install.rb
```

This `install.rb` will automatically copy all suckscript to **~/.local/bin/**.

If you doesn't have local path bin, it will create for you.

If you does have, don't worry, it **will not** replace all your files inside local path.

Just run it, you'll be safe.

**IMPORTANT!** You should to define your local PATH first. Or all suckscript that copied on **~/.local/bin/** can't be accessed from your shell. I dont want to describe here, just googling yaa.
